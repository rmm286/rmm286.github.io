      <div class="section-group-intro">
        <p>As <strong>Sr. Software Manager at Osaro</strong>, I architected a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) platform for industrial robotics. I designed the safety-critical control layer in Rust, bridging large-scale foundation models with physical actuation. I grew the engineering org from 5 to 12 and led multi-million dollar enterprise deployments (e.g. Home Depot, DHL)—owning on-site integration, hardware debugging, and architectural decisions.</p>
        <p>On the systems side, I built real-time inter-service communication with gRPC and Protobuf for low-latency streaming between distributed planning services and edge-deployed robot controllers. I also validated motion plans using the Bevy simulation framework for industrial 6-DOF arms, troubleshooting inverse-kinematics and motion-planning failures in live customer environments.</p>

        <h2>Gripper Interrupt Fix</h2>
        <p>Identified and diagnosed sensor register misconfigurations caused by an Object Dictionary file refactor in a CANopen-based gripper system for a strawberry-picking robot, impacting both vacuum and finger touch sensors.</p>
        <p>Investigated operational effects by analyzing CAN traffic and testing dynamic threshold adjustments, discovering defaulting behavior and low-level performance bottlenecks in Python-based polling loops.</p>
        <p>Implemented a custom CANopen reprogramming script, dynamically adjusting OD entries to restore functionality and improve sensor performance, achieving partial recovery but identifying operational risks.</p>
        <p>Quantified operational risks of dynamic reprogramming, finding a 10% failure rate rendering the gripper inoperable, leading to a cost-benefit analysis of immediate fixes versus systemic improvements.</p>
        <p>Proposed long-term solution, integrating OD reconfiguration into the commissioning process for future seasons to ensure robust deployment and sensor calibration, minimizing operational downtime.</p>

        <h2>Damage Mitigation in Robotic Harvesting Systems</h2>
        <p>Diagnosed fruit damage causes for apples and strawberries in robotic harvesting systems, identifying conveyance issues for apples and uneven distribution in bulk bins for strawberries.</p>
        <p>Designed and implemented a dynamic conveyance control system using the pick rate topic from a "picker" service to adjust PD4 motor velocity in real time, reducing conveyor bottlenecks.</p>
        <p>Enhanced the robotic arm motion controller for strawberries by adding randomized drop point generation to distribute fruit across bins evenly, minimizing bruising during bulk filling.</p>
        <p>Conducted simulations and A/B testing in field trials, collaborating with growers to quantify results, achieving a <strong>20% reduction in apple damage</strong> and a <strong>60% reduction in strawberry bruising</strong>.</p>
        <p>Proposed future enhancements, including sensor-based bin mapping for optimized drop placement and additional conveyor handling adjustments for further damage reduction.</p>
